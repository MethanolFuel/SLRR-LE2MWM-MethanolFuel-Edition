# Street Legal Racing Redline: LE2MWM MethanolFuel Edition
MethanolFuel's Street Legal build is finally on GitHub! And of course, he's ready to serve.

# The Purposes
The Street Legal Racing: Redline LE2MWM MethanolFuel Edition is a SLRR build made by MethanolFuel and Whooplash to bring you lots of content from other Street Legal Racing: Redline mods while achieving maximum playability. The game was primarly built to compete against SLRR: Light Edition due to of it's nature (and being based on a broken BigBoss93 SLRR build), by including the most hottest and the best mods you can get up to date.

# The Mods that are included
The following things are included in this game:
- Street Legal Racing: Redline 2.2.1 w/Miran Wichur Mod & LE2MWM.
- Amilmand's ExhaustiveBits w/AdditionalChassisFunctions and the Slrr_GI executable.
- mindeliszz's RevPhysicsAlpha with MrSir's Running Gear and Suspension Pack.
- Rear Suspension Camber fix.
- George Monroe's Option Dialogue.
- Akronis's CMS Brakes with some new updates by Fireful0 + RedCarDriver.
- Oxman99 and Nismofanatic's Adjustable Fuel Mod Open Beta.
- RedCarDriver's Headlight Adjustment and Control Mode (for car mods that supports fully-functioning pop-up headlights).
- Driftmonkey's fixed jack.
- Some of Lisanity's Adjustable Part Position scripts, provided by Defiant.
- A MWM Resolution Changer.
- RedCarDriver's LE-style catalog menus.
- Whooplash's script modifications, straight and inspired from a Street Legal Racing: Redline build. Hm.

# The Invision
This is the TRUE Street Legal Racing: Redline starter package. It isn't much stable in its current condition. But I will guarantee that you, as a modder, will be able to make mods with a game like this.

# The Bugs
- Valo City doesn't load properly when loading the map, it stays on the loading screen forever.
- Valo City crashes the game with poorly-scripted mods. This is not an issue with Valo City, and it is only an issue with the car mod. Use better car mods next time.
- My game crashed! What do I do?! Well, if you have way too many RPKs, the game wil obviously crash. It's not a surprise. The game is unstable in the beginning. Don't expect this build to be like NFS 2015.

# Why is it on GitHub
The invision was to share the build on GOM-Team as it was an exclusive that I made. Now? It's going to not only get published on GitHub, but it'll also be uploaded to the new ModdingForDummies website! That's right; a new website dedicated to most games and are willing to be super friendly.
